# Predicting the Sale price of Bulldozers using Machine learning

In this notebook, we are going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

## 1. Problem definition

> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?


## 2. Data

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle, which contains a CSV file with data about bulldozer sales in the United States 


## 3. Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

Note: the goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. for example, our goal for this project is to build a machine leaning model which minimizes RMSLE.


## 4. Features
Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset. You can view this data dictionary on Google Sheets:
